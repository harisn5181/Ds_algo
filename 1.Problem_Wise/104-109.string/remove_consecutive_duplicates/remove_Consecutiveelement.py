# Python3 program to remove consecutive
# duplicates from a given string.

# A iterative function that removes
# consecutive duplicates from string S
def removeDuplicates(S):
		
	n = len(S)
	
	# We don't need to do anything for
	# empty or single character string.
	if (n < 2) :

	# string (or index of current distinct
	# character)
	j = 0
	
	# Traversing string
	for i in range(n):
		
		# If current character S[i]
		# is different from S[j]
		if (S[j] != S[i]):
			j += 1 
			S[j] = S[i]
	
	# Putting string termination
	# character.
  
	j += 1
