1)list stores the refernces of the values,intead of the values
thats why we can store multiple types of data in list 

2)list uses continuous reference point.
for example then it is 4 byte . then refernes of the addres sh0ould be something like this 100 104 108 112

3)list follows a concept of resizing,
when we are going to append a element at 4rth position ,and that element is alread fill,list will double the size of the list where it can find continous 4 byte element (if it is 4 ,we will use 4 ,)

list can have start end and step
li=[1::]

For converting string of list into integer
for ele in string_of_list:
  append.li(int(ele))
other way is 
  li=[int (x) for x in input ().split()]


variables are immutable 
  list are mutable because they are only storing the reference of the elelment
